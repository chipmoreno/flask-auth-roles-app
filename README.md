## üåü Project Overview

DirectoryApp is a modern and user-friendly classifieds web application designed to connect local communities. Users can easily post, browse, and manage their advertisements for various goods and services. Built with a focus on core functionality and a clean interface, DirectoryApp aims to provide an efficient platform for local classifieds.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a robust web application using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap, covering essential features like user authentication, CRUD operations, advanced search, and efficient data display.

## ‚ú® Features

    * Filter by price range (minimum and maximum).
* **Pagination:** Efficiently browse large numbers of listings by breaking them into manageable pages.
* **Sponsored Listings:** Listings can be marked as "sponsored" to appear prominently at the top of search results (backend logic implemented).

* **Custom Error Pages:** User-friendly 404 (Not Found) and 403 (Forbidden) error pages for a polished user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap to ensure a consistent experience across various devices.

    * Flask-SQLAlchemy (ORM for database interaction)
    * SQLAlchemy (Database Toolkit)
    * SQLite (Development Database)
    * Flask-Login (User session management)
    * Flask-Bcrypt (Password hashing)
    * Flask-Migrate (Database migrations with Alembic)
    * SQLAlchemy-serializer (Optional, for easy model serialization)
* **Frontend:**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get DirectoryApp up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/directoryapp.git](https://github.com/your-username/directoryapp.git)  # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd directoryapp
2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you don't have a requirements.txt yet, run pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing your necessary packages, or manually add Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Bcrypt Flask-Login Flask-Migrate SQLAlchemy-serializer to a new requirements.txt file and then run pip install -r requirements.txt)

4. Initialize and Migrate the Database
DirectoryApp uses Flask-Migrate to manage database schema changes.

Bash

flask db init      # Only run this once for a new project
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration" # Create an initial migration script
flask db upgrade   # Apply pending migrations to the database
If you encounter issues during flask db upgrade (e.g., with is_sponsored column), refer to recent fixes in the project history, typically related to nullable=False without server_default for existing data.

5. Run the Application
Once the database is set up, you can start the Flask development server:

Bash

flask run
The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or a similar address).
